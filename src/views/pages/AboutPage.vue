        If you create an account your to-do's and categories will be synced to
        our server so you can access it on any device with internet connection.
        <span style="font-weight: 900;">That's amazing!</span>

      <h2>Use it on any device</h2>
      <p>
        Todoify is built with responsive design in mind. This means that Todoify
        works and looks good on both big screens like computers, and small
        screens like tablets and phones.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only requirement for using Todoify is that your device has an
        browser and active internet connection first time you enter
        <router-link :to="{ name: 'home.page' }">Todoify</router-link>
        Todoify will then be saved in your device cache memory and you can
        access it later on without an active internet connection. You can also
        install Todoify to your device home screen like a regular app.

      <h2>Offline support</h2>
      <p>
        You should always be able to use an app offline if your network is down.
        Todoify supports full offline mode. This means that if you loose your
        internet connection you can keep on using Todoify as before. When your
        internet connection comes back, Todoify will automatically sync your
        data to our server (if you have an account).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container text-center">
      <h2>Open source</h2>
      <p>
        Todoify is built on VueJS and using our Todoify server as backend. Both
        Todoify Client (this one you are visiting now) and Todoify Server is
        licensed under ISC license. So if you are a programmer and want to
        contribute to Todoify your are welcome to visit our code base at GitHub.
